Subject: Clarification on WFC Server Setup and Support Plan

Hi [Manager's Name],

As per the update from the Prime Force team, they require five WFC application servers along with a dedicated SQL database server. All these servers need to be set up in a high availability (HA) configuration, and they must be fully provisioned and ready before the go-live. The team has also mentioned that auto-scaling should not be enabled for these servers.

I’d like to confirm who will be responsible for performing this setup. If the Prime Force team is going to handle it, I’m happy to support them from the backend as needed.

However, if I am expected to set up the environment, I’m ready to take it up—but I would need backend support from their side during the setup. This way, we can validate the configuration together, make any required adjustments, and avoid delays. This will also help ensure the GCP environment is fully ready for go-live.

Please let me know which direction you’d prefer us to proceed with.

Best regards,

Subject: WFC Server Provisioning – Setup Ownership and Support Clarification

Hi [Manager's Name],

As per the recent update from the Prime Force team (please refer to the screenshots attached), they require five WFC application servers and one SQL database server, all configured in High Availability (HA) mode. These servers must be fully provisioned before go-live, and they've also mentioned that auto-scaling should not be enabled.

I’d like to clarify who will be responsible for performing this setup:

If Prime Force or another team is taking ownership of provisioning, I’m happy to support from the backend (e.g., validating infrastructure, configurations, etc.).

If I’m expected to set this up myself, I can proceed—but I’ll need backend support from their team to validate the setup in real-time and address any configuration needs promptly.

This collaborative approach will help us ensure that the GCP environment is ready for go-live without delays.

Please advise how you'd like to proceed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
